# Rank-A-Drank

For this project we used HTML, CSS, Javascript, existing third-party API’s and server side API’s to create an app with a dynamic user interface. We researched and utilized a variety of technologies (listed below) in order to make the app interactive, purposeful and asthetically pleasing. We embraced a collaborative approach to the creation of this app by using pair programming. We maintained an organized task flow by utilizing Github's project cards, issue submissions and branch protection rules so that we could review and approve updates to the app.

## App Overview

This app will allow a user to input or “check-in” a mixed-drink as they enjoy it.  They will then be able to rate that drink (out of 5 stars).  After submitting their rating, they will also be presented with personalized recommendations.  They will receive a recommendation for a different drink they may enjoy, based on the rating they provided. They will also see a list of 3 nearby venues so they can “keep the party going” and try a new selection.

## Future Developments
* Add dashboard feature where rated drinks are saved to the user's dashboard and listed in descending order from favorite drinks (5 stars) shown first to less-enjoyable (1 star) drinks
* Update storage to a system where ratings can be submitted globally and the average rating (of all users) for each drink will appear beneath the thumbnail of the drink
* Add social media component where users can follow one another, react and comment on each other's drink check-ins, and send meet-up invites for local venues
* Enable check-in services at local bars and restaurants where the user can tag the location where they are enjoying their drink and even provide a shout-out to the bartender who created the cocktail
* Provide photo-capabilities so that users can take a picture of their drink and submit it globally with their rating
* Create badges (awards/accomplishments) that users can earn by checking in drinks based on a variety of criteria and displaying these badges to their dashboard timeline -- ie: "The Trailblazer" badge:  "Congrats!  You were the first to check-in this drink at this location!  Don't forget to leave a review."
